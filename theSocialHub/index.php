        <h3>Our Vision</h3>
        <p>
            The Social Hub was envisioned by its founder, Brandon Miethe, after 
            a lifetime of existing on and around the internet. Social media has  
            become a necessity in the 21st century... there is no denying it. Our 
            vision is a platform focused on each user's desired experience. For 
            some, that may be an environment that is free of clutter and only 
            showing content that is relevant to them. For others, that might be 
            a fully immersive experience designed to keep them in the know about
            anything and everything! The Social Hub can be as little, or as much,
            as YOU want it to be.
